# Easy Exchange Rates

A simple, light-weight API service for exchange rates.

## APIs

So far we only have the Croatia National Bank API (HNB, Hrvatska Narodna Banka), but ideally this should extended to a few others as well.

The application is deployed on heroku on http://easy-exchange-rates.herokuapp.com (the URL will redirect to this page). All API's are simple GET requests, but the code should responde to other verbs as well. API endpoints are the following:

1. HNB original file: [/hnb/original](http://easy-exchange-rates.herokuapp.com/hnb/original)
2. HNB JSON: [/hnb/original](http://easy-exchange-rates.herokuapp.com/hnb/json)
3. HNB XML: [/hnb/original](http://easy-exchange-rates.herokuapp.com/hnb/xml)
